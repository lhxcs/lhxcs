- 👋👀 I’m Hanxuan Li, a third year undergraduate majoring in Computer Science and Technology in Zhejiang University.
  - My research interests now focus on two directions in deep learning:
    - Investigating the mathematical principles behind deep learning models to explain its empirical successes and failure modes.
    - Designing efficient algorithms to accelerate inference/training and reduce memory overhead.
